            <p class="what-is-text">Play-By-Post is a different way to experience tabletop RPGs. Rather than dedicating a few hours at a time to sit together around a table, you can play at your own convenience. Log in and respond to other players and the GM whenever you have a few minutes to spare.</p>
            <p class="what-is-text">Gamers' Plane offers you a PbP experience you wonâ€™t get anywhere else, focused around a community of gamers, with tools to make the experience as smooth as possible. You can play with old friends, or make new ones around the world!</p>
